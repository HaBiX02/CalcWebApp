## Idea
The idea is to make the Google Calendar website an application for Debian with Gnome

## Implementation
I am making this application by trying pake:
[https://github.com/tw93/Pake]

## Right now
The command i have used:

```
pake calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r
```
## WIP
It created the .deb file and worked fine, but i don't like it.
It needs:
- Icon of Google Calendar
- Name of Google Calendar
- Actually test it
